        <h2>Python is known for its readability and versatility</h2>
        <p class="pTag">Python, created by Guido van Rossum in <time datetime="1991">1991</time>, is one of the 
                        most popular programming languages in the world. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly, 
                        while its vast ecosystem of libraries powers web development, data science, AI, and automation.

                    <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
                    <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
                    <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. 
                        Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>

        <p class="pTag">Usually, most of the people begin learning a language through procedural code, where the tasks proceed a step at a time. 
                        It is the simplest form of coding. It is mostly used by non-programmers as it is a simple way to accomplish simpler and experimental tasks. 
                        It is used for iteration, sequencing, selection, and modularization.

        <h2>The C programming language is used often in operating systems and has influenced other languages for decades</h2>
        <p class="pTag">The C programming language is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming 
                        for the operating system UNIX and is an imperative programming language. 
                        C was developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. 
                        It is a procedural language, which means that people can write their programs as a series of step-by-step instructions. 
                        C is a compiled language.

                <b>C has influenced the development of many popular programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python, and it remains  widely used today. 
                   Below are interesting facts about C:</b>
                <li>Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs created C in the early 1970s as a systems programming language that is efficient and portable.</li>
                <li>Developers have used C to create a wide range of software applications, including operating systems, compilers, and games.</li>
                <li>C is known for its low-level programming capabilities, which allow developers to access and manipulate hardware directly.</li>
            </ul>                               
        </div>

        <p class="pTag">Even though itâ€™s not as common as it once was, you can write user applications in C. 
                        But higher level languages such as Java are often preferred today to write these, 
                        as their additional layers of abstraction enable the programmer to quickly write working programs.

        <h2>Programming Languages are the methods of communication between humans and computers</h2>
        <p class="pTag">Casual tech users are now more interested in programming With the exponential development of computing devices. 
                        Developers are constantly making new languages but only the well developed, user-friendly, efficient, and practical end up gaining popularity.
                        The fastest language is still debated as programming becomes more efficient. The ease or difficulty of compiling a program is what decides its portability. 
                        The top programming languages are changing and getting updated to be more optimized and efficient. 
                        In a matter of a couple years since their creation, languages like Python, javascript, and CSS have taken a vital role in many programs and applications we all use today.

        <h3>Python:</h3>
            <p class="pTag">Many people who look up what language to learn first, end up hearing Python. 
                            This is the case because Python mainly focuses on code, is easy to read, flexible, and minimal. 
                            This makes it easier to start whatever application they want.
                            Python can be used to build anything from applications to games, it has some strong suits. For one, the language is frequently used for data analysis, scripting, 
                            and scientific research, mainly because it includes a robust set of tools. 
                            But Python is also great for web app development and even for creating AI-based applications.
            </p>

        <h3>javaScript:</h3>
            <p class="pTag">javaScript been a fundamental part of our everyday lives for quite some time now simply because it's one of the essential pillars of most websites (along with HTML and CSS). 
                Through javaScript, web pages can dynamically appply changes to styles, animate menuse, validate data entered into a form without refreshing, and much more. 
                javaScript also works for web and mobile web development, as well as server applications and game.
            </p>

        <h3>C:</h3>
            <p class="pTag">A lot of people regard C as the most influencial programming language. 
                Given how influencial C has been to C++, C#, Objective C, Java, Python, JavaScript, and many more. 
                These languages borrowed many basic features from C (especially its control structures). 
                C was the first language to work on a higher level, opening the door for developing complez software with significantly less knowledge.
